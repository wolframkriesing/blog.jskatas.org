    <p>This article explains the vision of jskatas.org.
In short it is:</p>
<p><strong>Learn and re-learn (all of) JavaScript, at your level and your speed.</strong></p>
<p>The vision of jskatas is to enable learning all of JavaScript for anyone.
No matter a beginner or an expert. The site allows anyone to (re-)learn any part or anything
about JavaScript. Either you wish to learn a part of JavaScript (again) or you 
want to learn a new part of it, jskatas allows you to do that efficiently and actively.</p>
<p>Using jskatas requires you to <strong>actively</strong> work with and on the language. There
is no lean-back content that you can just consume and hope to have acquired knowledge,
this is NOT what jskatas offers, and also does not want to offer.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="learn-with-tests">Learn (With Tests)</h2>
<p>JSKatas strives to allows you to learn the language JavaScript profoundly.
The approach to learn is oriented around tests.</p>
<p>The learning is structured closesly aligned with how the language evolves.
Initially you might find the categories &quot;ES2015&quot; and alikes, which had been introduced
at some point to give people a kind of a versioning scheme for the language.
JSKatas structures its learnings using those categories and allows you to track
and learn all parts of JavaScript.</p>
<p>The learning itself can be called test-driven, because all one does is working with tests all the time.
Tests are an essential part of programming. How can you continuously prove that code works if
there are not coherent and expressive tests that can verify the functioning at any time?
Why not apply this approach for learning a programming language? That was the thought
when jskatas was created.</p>
<p>A test is made up of a good test description explicitly describing what the test is proving
or trying to prove. Each test description you find on jskatas strives to be explaining what
the code (the test) is teaching. Each test on jskatas represents a tiny bit of knowledge.
For example: <code>&#39;isInteger&#39; is a static function on &#39;Number&#39;</code>. This piece of info is knowledge
you can take away as soon as you read the test description. To make this knowledge really
stick the according test is failing and the learner is supposed to solve it. Sometimes solving
is a number of tries and thought processes, or call them learnings. Once learned by having
read and proven by making the initially failing test pass, the knowledge might stick easier and
once needed will be easy to recall and apply.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="re-learn">Re-Learn</h2>
<p>Re-learn is the part that I am most excited about and that I find most useful about jskatas
and, I believe that this part is far underevaluated by many.
Actually I am not really happy with the term &quot;re-learn&quot;, I am not sure if it captures the
intent best. Let&#39;s explore what it means.</p>
<p>I use jskatas to re-learn parts of JavaScript that I either did not use for a long time,
that I never used, that I forgot or parts where I am not sure how they really work.
Very often I came back to do the Map-katas because I used <code>Map</code> sporadically. Another one
that I often get wrong, even after many years of JavaScript is the Array method <code>sort()</code>, that&#39;s why I created the
ES1 kata on sort. You can see it is in JavaScript since ES1, for a long time, but still not as intuitive to
get it right all the time, at least for me.</p>
<p>JSKatas allows one to jump in whereever one wants and either re-learn a part of JavaScript
to harden the existing knowledge. There is no entry or exit point on jskatas, any point
can be a starting and ending point for learning. There are no fixed lessons or plans one
has to follow when learning. There are only pieces of knowledge that can be arranged and
re-arranged any time depending on the current interest.
That&#39;s why jskatas is also ideal for re-learning and hardening ones JavaScript knowledge.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="all-of-javascript">(All of) JavaScript</h2>
<p>As mentioned before JavaScript is very well structured and even versioned in a very understandable way.
ECMAScript 1 (ES1), ES5, ES6 or ES2015. The names make the evolution of JavaScript easy to understand
and allow jskatas to easily structure all the knowledge.</p>
<p>Due to this crystal clear and simple structure of the JavaScript knowledge it is also very easy to
measure how much of JavaScript one can learn using jskatas, and also how much jskatas provides
to be learned. Currently I would claim that <a href="https://jskatas.org/#bundle-es6-katas">80% of ES6</a> 
can be learned using jskatas, but how much of all JS, that is left to be made measurable correctly.
This is not done yet.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why the &quot;All of&quot; in the headline is set in parantheses, jskatas does not provide all of 
JS to be learnable yet, but measuring it is not that difficult using the approach of providing
knowledge as jskatas does it.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="at-your-level">At Your Level</h2>
<p>As mentioned before all of JS is provided and learnable on jskatas, so one can also find out
and start at any level. Due to all the knowledge being available it is easy to structure and
offer a learning path for any level.</p>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="at-your-speed">At Your Speed</h2>
<h2 is="more-h2" id="sustainability">Sustainability</h2>
<h3 is="more-h3" id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>You own your data. Always.</p>
<h3 is="more-h3" id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>The site and the code is open source. </p>
